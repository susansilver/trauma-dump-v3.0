Tabletop RPG Space is a place to talk about uncomfortable things. Mostly about mental health and the consequences of trauma. The lens we use to discuss this is Dimension 20. This actual play tabletop role-playing game show has great representation. Making it a great launching point to talk about these issues.

Dungeons & Dragons was always my way of exploring my identity. It allows you to be other people. Try out other ways of being when you aren’t ready to do it yourself. Something critical for me as a young adult. It is something you can do when you are playing with people who make you feel safe.

This blog is about me coming to terms with the things that happened to me. To make sense of a senseless world. Talking about it is something that I never thought I could do. So, I’m going to try. It may help some other people along the way.

Topics that we may cover are mental health, trauma, asexuality, and gender identity.
